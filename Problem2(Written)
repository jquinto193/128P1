When we plug in values where |Z| > 2 We have a quickly diverging sequence that blows up to infinity. Therefore we have no points
inside the set. When we look at the fractal that is generated by different values of C we cannot find any points outside or the unit circle
with radius square root of 2 that converge in the julia set. Therefore julia sets are confined to a domain which is inside the circle of
radius square root of 2 for different values of C.

We see from the first part of the question that any initial value of z0 with modulus greater than 2 is not in the set. However, depending
on what values for C we choose, we are able to generate a different Julia set. So in the images generated, any of the points within the red
area is a convergent value of z0 but we cannot know whether or not it converges without a particular value of c.
