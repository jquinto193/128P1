if the orb(0) is bounded then the Julia set is connected (that is any two points in the set can be joined by a line).
this means that by definition, the mandelbrot set M is the set of all values of complex numbers c, for which the Julia sets are connected.
which is the same as saying z_0 = 0+0i. though, at orb(0), the iterations of 0 remain connected and determines whether the Julia set is
connected or not. when iterated at point c and z = 0, we see that the number of iterations it takes for a starting point to diverge of 
|z| > 100 , makes the mandelbrot set of divergent points which we see in this code. at 2 points (julia set , straight line), we also see
the rate at which each points diverges. nonconnected julia set points are those that diverge. and by definition in the book "black points
are the values of c for which the julia set is connected, while the sahding of other points indicates the rate at which the fixed point
iteration applied to z^2 + c with z_0 = 0 diverges".

c = x + 1i * y; %julia set of complex number c
z = 0; % orb(0)
M = zeros(size(c));

for j = 1:itr
    z   = z.^2 + c;
    M(abs(z) > 100 & M == 0) = itr - j; %divergence occours at |z| > 100
