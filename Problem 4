Fractal dimension is a measure of the 'zoom' or scale of a fractal. 
It can also be thought of as a measure of how 'complicated' a self similar image is.
One way to calculate this is given by the formula Fractal dimension D = log(N)/log(1/r).
Where N is the number of distinct copies (or seld-similar pices) and (1/r) is how much the copy is scaled down.
For example, if we have a square that is two by two and we scale it down to one by one, then out ratio is 1/2, where r=2.
So with this, we can conclude that the fractal dimension of a square is 2. But this isn't the end of the story. we can go
further than this by using what's known as the box counting method. If we count the number of boxes touched by the object 
then do the same for a scaled version then the ratio of boxes touched will tell us the fractal dimension that we are
looking for. When we compute the julia set for C=.36 +.1i we can run a line of code to extract the number of ones in M which gives 14907.
Then we scale the julia set by a factor of .75 (by multiplying z by .75) than we compute the number of points in the julia set again
to get 26519 points. Then we can compute the fractal dimension by solving the equation area=c*(scale)^dimension. Solving this equation
using logarithms we get dimension = [log( 14907) - log(26519)]/(log(.75)-log(1)) which comes out to about 2.002316 or ~2.
 
Similarly, the julia set generated by C= .123-0.745i has 13027 points in the julia set and when scaled by 0.75 we get 23241 points in 
the set. which gives fractal dimension as [log(13027) - log(23241)]/(log(.75)-log(1)) = 2.01226, again ~2.

And finally when c=0 (the filled julia set is the unit disc) we have the number of points in M, as computed is 31403
(approximately pi because the area is pi*r^2=pi when r=1). And we can follow the same prescription as before and scale by .75 to get
M = 55869 to get  [log(31403) - log(55869)]/(log(.75)-log(1)) =~ 2.00257. Again about 2. So it seems that no matter the julia set we choose
it's fractal dimension is always 2.
