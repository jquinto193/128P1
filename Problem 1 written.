A fractal is a set in the cartesian plane which is connected meaning that for every point, all points in between are within the set.
A fractal can also be zoomed in upon to produce a pattern that continues to progress for any amount of scaling. Orbit is an iteration or
sequence defined by some operation. For example the iteration f(x)=|z|^2-1 is the 0th orbit. and the 1st orbit f composed with itself
i.e. f(f(0))=||z|^2-1|-1 and so on.

Julia set: The filled Julia set any point for which the orbit (or iteration) is bounded. The boundary is simply called the Julia set. 
Filled julia set is similar to the area and the Julia set is similar to the perimeter. 

Mandelbrot set: The mandelbrot set is the set of values for C in which the Julia set is connected.
